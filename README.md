# Warehouse IT Asset & Support Tracking Project
**Target Role:** Key User / System Administrator (Logistics) at FIEGE

This project demonstrates your ability to:
1. Handle logistics IT systems and hardware tracking (Mobile Scanners, Tablets).
2. Write SQL to generate reports and controlling metrics.
3. Problem-solving and error analysis for 1st-Level IT Support.

## Step 1: Generate the Database
1. Make sure you have **Python** installed on your computer.
2. Open your terminal or Command Prompt.
3. Navigate to this folder:
   `cd "Desktop\Data Analyst Project\Warehouse_IT_Project"`
4. Run the Python script to generate the database:
   `python setup.py`
5. You will now see a file called `warehouse_it_support.db` in this folder. This contains mock data for 50 employees, 150 IT devices, and 450 support tickets.

## Step 2: Use SQL to Analyze the Data
To execute the SQL queries, you need an SQL viewing tool. I recommend **DBeaver** or **DB Browser for SQLite** (both are free).
1. Download [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
2. Open DB Browser, click **"Open Database"**, and select the `warehouse_it_support.db` file.
3. Go to the **"Execute SQL"** tab.
4. Open the `queries.sql` file provided in this folder, copy the queries, and run them one by one.
5. Take screenshots of your results! These show that you know how to write clean `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `AVG()` queries.

## Step 3: Presenting the Project (For your Resume & Interview)
To make this stand out, you shouldn't just send them SQL code. You should show them *what the data means*.
**Do this:**
1. Export the results of your SQL queries to Excel (CSV).
2. Create 2 or 3 simple charts (e.g., a Bar Chart showing "Most Common Scanner Issues" and a Pie Chart showing "Open vs Closed Tickets").
3. Make a 2-page PDF or PowerPoint titled **"Logistics IT Support Analysis"**.
4. Include the SQL snippets, the charts, and a short summary of how an IT Administrator would use this data to improve the warehouse (e.g., *"We found 35% of issues are related to Wi-Fi connectivity on the Zebra Scanners—we should optimize Wi-Fi access points in the Outbound area."*).

Good luck with your application to FIEGE!
